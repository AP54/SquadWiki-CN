## General Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug that could cause a loud clicking noise to be heard immediately after switching maps
- Fixed a client crash related to weapon sounds overwhelming the audio system
- Fixed a bug that caused the Commander creeping barrage area attack width indicator on the minimap to appear more narrow than the attack actually was
- Fixed a UI issue when placing director lines around other markers on the minimap,  which then prevented the markers from being able to be deleted
- Fixed a UI issue in the server browser to no longer include the game version number in the the “Mode” column when you are running the same version of the game that the server is being played on
- Fixed a bug that allowed deployables to be placed on top of vehicles, which would then stay in place even after the vehicle had moved away
- Fixed a UI bug that could prevent the server browser mod details pop-up from appearing when joining a modded server that included a mod which players did not have installed
- Fixed a visual issue with the right-side tracks on the PLA ZTZ99A MBT
- Fixed an issue that force lowered soldier weapons when walking through certain camo netting
-  Fixed a UI bug that could cause the role request button to overlap with the vehicle claim request button on the radial menu after interacting with an ammo crate
- Fixed an issue with the iron sights alignment for the IMF M16A2 rifle, they should now be properly lined up
- Fixed a minor UI issue with the PLA ZBD04A IFV’s turret indicator appearing incorrect for the commander seat
- Fixed a minor visual issue that caused the antenna on the back of the USA M1126 M2 APC to load incorrectly and look more like a plant than an antenna
- Fixed a bug that allowed IMF infantry to place unlimited sandbags instead of the intended limit of 10 per player

## SDK Updates & Bug Fixes

- Updated mod SDK to v5.0

- Updated mod versioning to v5.0. This requires mods to be re-cooked with the v5.0 SDK—any mods using the v4.5 SDK will be incompatible with v5.0
