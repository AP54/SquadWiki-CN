**Features**

This update introduces the Turkish Land Forces faction, a new set of emotes, and a new weapon skin system:

## TURKISH LAND FORCES (TLF)

The Turkish Land Forces join Squad as a capable, Independent faction that fields strong infantry, and good vehicles. They boast a mix of domestically produced, Soviet, and Western equipment and although some of their vehicles are older, they make up for it with highly capable infantry. The infantry has access to an extra grenadier role, including one equipped with the MGL, a powerful semi-automatic grenade launcher, a raider role equipped with a modern submachine gun, and can field more light anti-tank weapons than other factions but lack a dedicated heavy anti-tank role.

**Mod SDK Update**

- Updated the mod SDK to v7.0

- Updated mod versioning to v7.0. This means that all mods will need to be re-cooked with the v7.0 SDK to be compatible with the updated version of the game.

**Known Issues**

- We are aware of an issue that allows players to “aim down sights” while equipped with a melee weapon. While we work on a fix for the issue, please be aware of this and consider it if you run into any issues while holding a melee weapon. Some features like the emote and interaction wheels are not accessible when aimed down sights, so keep that in mind.

- The “Find Match” feature is not currently working. We are working on a fix for this that we will provide in an update soon after the release of v7.0.

- Occasionally, a server that is not live may appear in the server browser. This is specific to servers that are running in a Windows environment and have been restarted recently. It resolves itself in a couple of minutes. The issue is not present when a server is run in a Linux environment.

- When using DLSS with Frame Generation Enabled, the  command will not show the correct FPS. This is due to how  works by relying on the amount of frames being requested by the CPU. The Nvidia Overlay will show actual FPS. We have a fix for this slated for a future release.
